# Contributing to Project Vee Builder

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Project Vee Builder. It's people like you that make Project Vee Builder such a great tool.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before submitting a bug report, please check our issue list to avoid duplicates. If the problem hasn't been reported yet, you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/projectveebuilder/issues/new). Please provide as much information as possible.

### Suggesting Enhancements

If you have a suggestion that is not a bug and it hasn't been proposed before, you can [open a new issue](https://github.com/yourusername/projectveebuilder/issues/new).

### Your First Code Contribution

If you're looking to get your hands dirty and contribute code, start by looking through the 'Good first issue' labeled issues:

- 'Good first issue' issues should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.

### Pull Requests

- Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
- Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
- Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent.
- You may merge the Pull Request in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.
