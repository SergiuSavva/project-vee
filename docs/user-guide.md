## Overview

Project Vee Builder is an application that runs on GitHub Pages and enables you to generate the necessary configuration files for setting up ephemeral environments in a Kubernetes cluster. With Project Vee Builder, you can select your preferred platform (AWS, GCP, Azure, etc.), CI/CD tool (GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI, etc.), and specify your domain name.

## Selecting a Platform

To select a platform, navigate to the 'Platform' section of the form. Here, you can choose from AWS, GCP, Azure, On-Premises, and more.

## Choosing a CI/CD Tool

In the 'CI/CD Tool' section of the form, you can select your preferred continuous integration and continuous deployment tool. Choices include GitHub Actions, Jenkins, CircleCI, and others.

## Specifying a Domain Name

In the 'Domain Name' section of the form, input the domain name you plan to use with your Kubernetes cluster. This will be used in the generated configuration files.

## Downloading and Using the Configuration Files

Once you've filled out the form, click the 'Submit' button. Project Vee Builder will generate a ZIP file containing the necessary configuration files based on your inputs.

Download this ZIP file, and use the provided configuration files to set up your ephemeral environments in your Kubernetes cluster. Follow the instructions provided in the configuration files to deploy your environments.
